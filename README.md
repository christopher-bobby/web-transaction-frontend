# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Future improvements
- cookies based authentication
- better error handling
- server side rendering implementation
- Overall UI
- Overall code management
- Global state management
- CSS naming conventions
  etc

### Things to consider
- this web isn't built using best practices / approaches as it serves for quick prototyping to test backend code

### Please consider this
- 90% of the code was built only on the weekend, alongside with the backend code, as I had no holiday and main job was trimming me down.
